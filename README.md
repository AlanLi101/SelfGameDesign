🎮 2D Adventure Game
---

A 2D platformer game built with Python & Pygame, featuring character movement, obstacle challenges, and an in-game economy system.**
This project is a personal development exercise aimed at mastering Pygame and GitHub workflow. 
The goal is to create a **fun and interactive** game where players control a character, explore different levels, avoid obstacles, and purchase upgrades from the shop.

🚀 Game Progress
- ✅ Character movement & jumping
- ✅ Level management (loading & transitions)
- ⏳ Obstacle generation & physics (In Progress)
- ⏳ Shop system (To Be Developed)
- ⏳ UI design (To Be Developed)
